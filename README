# LCS and SCS Calculator with Trie Support

## Overview

This project provides robust implementations for calculating the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and the Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS) between two sequences. It also includes a custom Trie data structure to enhance certain operations, such as efficiently managing and retrieving subsequences (trie is added for the sake of practice :P).

## Project Structure

The source code is organized into separate directories for each component:

- `main.cpp`
- `lcs/`: `lcs.cpp` and `lcs.h`
- `scs/`: `scs.cpp` and `scs.h`
- `trie/`: `trie.cpp` and `trie.h`

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a modern C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later. This project is developed with `g++` as the primary compiler.

### Compilation with Makefile

A Makefile is provided for easy compilation of the project. Use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
make        # Compiles the project and creates the executable
make clean  # Cleans up all compiled files, ensuring a fresh build
